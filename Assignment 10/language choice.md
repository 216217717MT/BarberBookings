# Language Choice & Design Decisions

**Python Language**

For this project i chose  **Python** as the implementation language due to its simplicity, readability, and well-defined **syntax**. Python allows for rapid development and clear **object-oriented design** and is a good choice for translating UML class diagrams into executable code. My prior experience and background in using Python assisted in this decision, as it enabled me to focus on the core design patterns and business logic without needing to struggle with learning curves or syntax.

Furthermore, Python offers strong support for: **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** which is necessary for modeling real-world objects and relations. **Design Pattern Implementation**  with class and module systems that are flexible enough to allow the usage of creational patterns such as Factory, Singleton, Builder, etc. **Testing Frameworks**  like unittest and pytest, which facilitate easy adoption and upkeep of unit testing. Overall, Python provided a middle ground between development time and maintainable structure, getting the system working and in accordance with design principles.
