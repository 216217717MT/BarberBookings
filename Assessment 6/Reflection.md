# REFLECTION

**Reflection on Challenges in Prioritization, Estimation, and Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs.**

working on this project by myself as the sole stakeholder presented certain challenges when applying Agile methodology. Prioritization was one of the primary challenges I encountered. Agile methodology, particularly the MoSCoW prioritization technique, emphasizes the identification of the most important user stories for the system to be successful. But as I was product owner and the development team, it was difficult to step back and gauge what would bring the most value to the system from an end-user perspective.

The next challenge I encountered was estimation effort for each user story. As the only individual developing the system, it became inherently difficult to estimate the amount of time required to carry out tasks such as developing the real-time availability checker and client profile management. I lacked the external perspective of the complexity of each task and tended to overestimate or underestimate the time each feature would take to be developed. In some cases, I over-complicated certain stories, attempting to break them down into smaller, more fine-grained tasks, when in reality the complexity would have been more manageable in fewer, larger tasks. At the other end of the spectrum, there were a few stories which were so simple that I underestimated the effort required, leading to unexpected delays.

Since I lacked a team to consult with regarding technical dependencies and blockers, some of the estimates were done based solely on assumptions and not on informed collaboration. For instance, integrating the payment gateway consumed more research and implementation time than I had initially estimated, which affected other planned work in the sprint. This served as a lesson in the importance of refining estimations with team input, and I had to adjust my behavior accordingly midway through the project.

Lastly, aligning Agile principles with one stakeholder's requirement had its own issues. Agile development generally requires collaboration with the customer to deliver incremental improvements. In this project, however, being the sole stakeholder, there was no one else to provide feedback and validate my priorities. I had to continuously trust my instincts and internal expectations of the project. This created a sense of resistance within myself, as I wanted to make sure the system would meet a hypothetical stakeholder's needs, despite having no one else to talk to and agree on these needs.

Furthermore, the ongoing iteration in Agile development where features were iterated upon according to feedback was a challenge because there wasn't an external feedback loop to iterate over the product. I had to review myself and query if each feature was indeed solving the right problem for possible end-users. Had it not been for this external influence, I would second-guess myself as to whether the priorities were correct and if the features would even be of use to another individual.

In summary, being the only stakeholder of this Agile process posed internal and external complexities in prioritization, estimation, and aligning Agile with stakeholder need. It made me actively think “out of the box” about what was most important to feature, accurately guess task duration without external input.
