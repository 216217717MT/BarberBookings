# Reflection: Challenges Faced in Balancing Stakeholder Needs

The process of reconciling stakeholder needs presented several challenges during the development of the **Online Booking System for Barbershops**, However, these challenges were careful analysis, prioritization, and compromises were used to overcome these obstacles, guaranteeing that the concerns of all stakeholders were considered fairly while preserving the system's general production and success. The following system requirements were full observed;

### **Ensuring Scalability vs. Security**
To manage an increasing number of users and bookings, particularly during peak hours, the system had to be scalable. However, the security of user data needs to be balanced with scaling initiatives. It was difficult to implement secure authentication techniques **(two-factor authentication for administrators)** and strong encryption **(AES-256)** while making sure the system could tolerate a spike in traffic. Because cloud hosting enables dynamic scaling without compromising security, it was selected as the deployment platform to address this issue. This necessitated incorporating security measures into the system design at all levels.

### **Complex Features vs. User-Friendly Design**
Creating a **customer-friendly interface** while making sure all necessary functionalities were present was one of the main challenges. Clients wanted a **user-friendly interface** and intuitive experience, particularly those who were less tech-savvy. Complexity was increased by a few necessary features, though, such profile administration, payment integration, and appointment change. Simplifying the **UI** without sacrificing functionality was the difficult part. To satisfy customer expectations and provide the extensive functionality that the system required, a clear and efficient user flow was crucial.

### **Performance vs. Real-Time Data Updates**
To prevent duplicate bookings, the system needed real-time availability updates for appointment scheduling. However, a high level of system speed was required to implement real-time changes. It was difficult to strike the ideal balance between preserving **high-speed performance** (with short loading times) and guaranteeing that the system updated availability promptly. This was resolved by employing excellent caching strategies and streamlining the **database queries**, which made sure the system could grow without lagging.

### **Cost vs. Managing Payment Integration**
The **owners** of the barbershop desired an integrated payment gateway so that clients could make **payments online**. However, it was difficult to integrate a dependable and safe payment system while maintaining minimal operating costs. Using a popular, safe **payment gateway** **(like Stripe)**, which offered strong capabilities at comparatively low setup and transaction costs, was the chosen alternative. Although there was an additional operational expense, this was offset by the anticipated rise in productivity and client satisfaction..

### **Addressing Barbershop Owner vs. Barber Needs**
The barbers' need for autonomy in scheduling frequently clashed with the barbershop owner's demands for administrative oversight and efficient operations. Barbers required a quick and easy way to view and modify their availability without interfering with the booking process of the entire system. To keep an eye on business success, the owner of the barbershop needed complete insight into the schedules of the barbers. The idea was to provide the owner and the barbers access to a shared **dashboard** where they could control schedules. Restrictions were put in place to prevent overlap and preserve the integrity of the system.

### **Advanced Features vs. Accessibility**
Another problem was making sure the system offered advanced capabilities like **profile management and payment integration** while remaining accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. The system needed to adhere to **WCAG 2.1** and other accessibility guidelines. This was accomplished by keeping the more sophisticated features that clients would anticipate while maintaining a **straightforward layout**, appropriate color contrast, and keyboard navigation.

### **Conclusion**
A crucial component of this project was juggling the various and occasionally incompatible demands of **stakeholders**. Clear communication, realistic priority-setting, and decision-making that made the system both workable and **user-friendly** were all part of the solution. The difficulties encountered presented a chance to develop a more flexible and detailed system, guaranteeing that both barbershop owners and patrons would gain from an improved booking experience.
