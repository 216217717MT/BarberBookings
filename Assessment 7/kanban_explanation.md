# Definition and purpose of Kanban

**Kanban Board Explanation**:

**Kanban board** is one of the visual systems for workflow management by which the work can be traced through stages of completion. It supports easy flow by maintaining work in sight, preventing overload, and supporting ongoing improvement.

**Visualizing Workflow**

My board has columns for different tasks: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Testing, Blocked, and Done.
Tasks move from left to right as they advance, providing a clear indication at any given time regarding the status of the project.

**Limiting Work-In-Progress** (WIP)

To prevent bottlenecks, I have WIP limits such that I never have more than 3 tasks in a column (except To Do and Done).
This encourages focus, prevents overload, and ensures work is completed long before the new one begins.

**Adopting Agile Principles**

**Continuous Delivery**:  Work is performed iteratively such that there are frequent updates and releases.

**Collaboration**:  Assigning tasks to team members makes them accountable and allows for easy task delegation.

**Adaptability**:  When priorities change, tasks can be moved or re-prioritized without halting the workflow
