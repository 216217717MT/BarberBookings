# Comparison Table

| Feature                | Basic Kanban       | Automated Kanban       | Bug Triage          |
|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Columns & Workflows** | To Do, In Progress, Done | To Do, In Progress, Review, Done | New Issues, In Progress, Needs Triage, Resolved |
| **Automation Features** | No automation     | Problems with auto-moving between columns in response to status updates | Auto-triage new bugs into appropriate categories |
| **Suitability for Agile** | Good for simple Agile workflows (Scrum/Kanban) | Perfect for Agile teams that use automated Kanban | More appropriate for bug-tracking processes than Agile sprint planning |
| **Best Use Case** | Managing sprints manually | Using automation to manage sprints | Effectively managing bug reports |
| **Effort in Managing Tasks** | Requires manual updating | Manual work is Reduces with automation | Prioritizes bug fixes over feature development. |

# Justification

Automated Kanban template is the best template for my project because it offers built-in automation that simplifies automating the sprint process. Compared to Basic Kanban, where updating is manual, the Automated Kanban template moves tasks automatically between stages whenever there's a status change. This removes administrative overheads and allows me to focus on actual development work.

Additionally, as my project involves Agile sprint planning, Automated Kanban template allows smooth workflow of activities from To Do → In Progress → Review → Done, making it easier for me to track progress and reach sprint goals more effectively.

In contrast with Bug Triage that focuses more on issue tracking rather than feature building, Automated Kanban presents an even balance formula between user stories, sprint backlog, and automated work. It is aligning perfectly with the work I have done in Assessments 5 and 6. With Automated Kanban, I can effectively manage the sprint, monitor user stories, and allow tasks to move smoothly, required to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) per sprint iteration.
