# Reflection: Lessons I learned

During this evaluation, I gained great insights on Agile project management, especially on Kanban board implementation and backlog management. Among the important lessons that I have learned are:

**The Significance of a Well-Organized Kanban:** flow. The ability to create specialized columns like "Testing" and "Blocked" helped track quality assurance and dependencies, which are fundamental in Agile processes.

**Establishing Automation-Manual Balance:** GitHub Projects has automation for tracking progress, but I found that there is still a need for manual monitoring, especially for the upkeep of Work-In-Progress (WIP) limits and prioritization of backlog items. Unlike Jira, which has automatic WIP limits, GitHub required team discussion and discipline in order not to be overwhelmed with tasks.

**Prioritization is More Difficult Than Anticipated:** Prioritizing user stories from earlier assessments into backlog items of prioritized format was more difficult than anticipated. The MoSCoW technique of prioritization was useful, yet effort levels in story points proved difficult to estimate without real-world experimentation. This taught me that the estimates need to be flexible and refined with the passage of time.

**Task Assignment and Accountability Issues:** By applying the @mentions to assigning responsibilities made it clear whose was what. This is important in Agile development with groups, where accountability makes tasks proceed without a glitch. Even though I was the only stakeholder, this did help to impress upon me the importance of identified roles and accountability in a real project

**Choosing the Right Agile Tool is Crucial:** Comparing GitHub Projects, Trello, and Jira taught me that each of the tools has weaknesses and strengths. GitHub Project was the best fit for my project because of seamless GitHub integration. Trello is visually intuitive but lacks structured backlog management. Jira is feature-complete but possibly too complex for small projects. Therefore, this taught me that the choice of Agile tooling must be dependent on the size, complexity of the project, and experience of the team
